Project planninig notes for AWS assignment

1. train val test split: 0.7, 0.2, 0.1.
	using val to determine if overfitting while training
	once determined and properly trained, merge val to train and train for one more epoch
	use test to finally see the performance

2. use sub/over sampling on the different classes to balance out the dataset.
	we have 6 classes and the label distribution is very very dire and we do not know the natural distribution
	see the performance first before we determine
	I think they'll want me to iterate and decide on a proper strategy before I move forward
